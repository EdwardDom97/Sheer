Welcome to Sheer Version 1.0 made by Tristan E. Dombroski, me.

This game features a heavily GUI (Graphics User Interface) gameplay through the use of managing resources, hiring units, and building structures to compete against an enemy army. I am trying to make a largely click based simple game rather than all my previous
projects being some form of top-down or platformer. Still in the bare bones of development there is a few different states (coding perspective)

MENU  # mostly displays buttons
GAME # allows user to select a base type and difficulty
BATTLE # main game phase where player hires units and builds until the timer is up

as of right now there is no available demo but there will be soon on itch.io and a youtube video covering it.
